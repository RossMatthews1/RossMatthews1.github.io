<p>Various kinds of CCTV cameras. While burglar alarm innovation has actually developed considerably given that the 19th century, it is still based on the basic principles innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell.

<p>You're in the eye of the public when you're in a public area. So what's the distinction in being enjoyed by a closed circuit TV camera? If you were caught selecting your nose the cops aren't going to detain you for that and no surveillance officer is going to put it on national television, even.
