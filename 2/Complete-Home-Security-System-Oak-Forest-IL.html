<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great alternative for long variety situations where poles and trees are not present.</p>
<p>However, in any scenario where standard-definition camera are utilized, the quality is going to be poor since the optimum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TELEVISION lines but the outcomes are the exact same); they usually capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is generally 30 frames per second.</p>
