<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of totally free storage, and utilize two AA batteries that can last as much as two years. However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink doesn't provide you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.

<p>3 big advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their expandability, portability and impermanence. Occupants, unlike homeowners, typically avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can easily be set up at various properties later, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new elements too. Wireless security plans also enable push-button control of the system and general home automation.
