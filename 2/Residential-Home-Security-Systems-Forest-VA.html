<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
