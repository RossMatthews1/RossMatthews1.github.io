<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems meant to summon cops department workers, needs registration, assessment of charges for extreme false alarm system, supplies procedures for repeat culprits, and offers an effective date. Whether you're using a wireless IP-based system or register for a security component as a part of a "smart home" plan; these innovations rely on user passwords to arm and disarm them.
