<p>Energy efficiency. Among the very best benefits of a wireless home security system is that it can link to other clever home automation devices. WiFi-connected devices, such as wise thermostats, lights and energy management systems, can conserve both time and money.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
