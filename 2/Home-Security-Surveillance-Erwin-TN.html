<p>The box-style camera is what most people think of when they think security camera." The most commonly-used security cameras, box-style cameras allow for great flexibility in lens customization. While they are utilized most often, box-style cameras are not the most attractive. You may consider this style for outdoor areas or where design is not important in an indoor area.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
