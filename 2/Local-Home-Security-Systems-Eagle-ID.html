We need to again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates.

And some cameras have unique features that exceed those fundamentals.

You can set up notifies with "Home", "Away", and "Sleep" modes in the app. Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they record; everything within their focus ability is caught.
