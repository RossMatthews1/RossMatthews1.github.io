<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be considered. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
