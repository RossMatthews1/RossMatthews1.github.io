<p>Finally, the Authorities Department and the Village frequently get requests to waive incorrect alarm costs. By regulation, just incorrect alarms triggered by hurricanes, twisters, earthquake or other catastrophic occasions, are subject to appeal. Alarms activated by electrical storms, thunder, hail, or unexpected modifications in temperature do not satisfy the standards for waiver of false alarm costs. Alarms activated by legal but accidental entry to the home, i.e. children returning home, guests, next-door neighbors taking care of the home while you are on getaway and shipment men do not satisfy the standard for waiver.</p>
