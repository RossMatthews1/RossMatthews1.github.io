The owners of buildings can be fined for generating false alarms that waste the time of emergency situation personnel. Per Mar Security Services has actually been securing countless homes and organisations since 1953. B. In case the assessment is promoted, the owner or burglar alarm company will also be responsible for repayment to the AHJ for any legal costs or expenses incurred by the AHJ in enforcement of this chapter.
