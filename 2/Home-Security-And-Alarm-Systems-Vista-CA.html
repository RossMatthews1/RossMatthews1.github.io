<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the specific same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut.

If somebody were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic.

However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
