<h3>Domestic Burglar Alarm Systems in New Albany IN</h3>

Homeowners can pick between a landline, broadband or cellular linked system, and the system is controlled through a base station rather than through a keypad on a control board like most home security systems. This gives you added defense versus creative criminals who know how to disable a system through harming the control board. Devices that come with the SimpliSafe system include the SimpliCam, an indoor camera with a motion sensing unit and HD video quality, and a keychain remote used to arm or deactivate the system. Simplisafe does not include home automation functions, besides Nest combination, which might be a turn off for some.</p>
