<p>Twenty-five years back, basic and business communications were mainly synchronous. To achieve practically anything, someone live" required to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when dealing with nationwide and global business. The exact same is true for security and video surveillance. Generally, CCTV is most effective as an active system, with a security personnel monitoring the corridors and somebody else, someplace, viewing video surveillance screens for assistance. Everything is integrated and everything happens in real time.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
