The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image.

A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of finding tiny differences in temperature level. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from items in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon details about the temperature level differences. Since items are seldom exactly the exact same temperature level as other things around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
