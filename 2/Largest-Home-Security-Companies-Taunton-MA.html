<p>Among IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A typical misconception is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the web. Finally, wire-free cameras are entirely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the most convenient option to install and all of the taped footage is stored in the cloud.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
