Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Location sensing is really beneficial as it can inform when you get home or leave (utilizing your phone's GPS) and turn alarms and camera on or off appropriately.
