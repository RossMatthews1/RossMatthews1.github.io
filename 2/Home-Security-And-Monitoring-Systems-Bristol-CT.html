In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
