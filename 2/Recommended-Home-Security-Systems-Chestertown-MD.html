<p>While every house owner frets about break-ins, skepticism has actually surrounded home security systems due to their typically high expenses, complicated contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces frequently resulting in incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a totally free smartphone app that permits residents who see something suspicious to take a photo and rapidly send it to public safety authorities. For example, a public transit rider may observe somebody acting suspiciously. Lots of people are fiddling, surfing or texting with their mobile devices.

(We think this is a more valuable feature if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where cars regularly pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's excellent that it's not required, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Webcam.</p>
