These devices are weatherproof and generally require a nearby GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) outlet to supply power, although there are a handful of battery-powered designs out there. Similar to their indoor equivalents, outdoor cameras link to your Wi-Fi network and enable you to view live video from your phone.

If trespassers can not see any security cameras, they might also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
