<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most hard setup known to man. Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi information. (You need to play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets wail, cats scream, children cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
