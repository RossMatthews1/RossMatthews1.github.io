Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network.

<p>Nurse calling systems typically consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's bathroom. If a client is having problem, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is usually open or usually closed. Most of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and notifies, sensors, gain access to control, and so on.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding by itself.

With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
