A Web procedure camera is a digital camera that sends and receives information by means of a computer network. This differs from a CCTV camera, which can only send and get signals through a cable connected to a DVR.</p>
<p>Wireless: Wireless security cameras transmit information either through radio frequencies or over a Wi-Fi network. This eliminates the requirement for cable televisions, enabling installation to be much easier than wired security cameras. If essential, Wireless systems also make it easy to move and rearrange your cameras. Many wireless systems consist of Wi-Fi cameras - or IP cameras - that deal with a smart device app for remote control access, cloud storage and livestream footage.

Both also do not have individual detection and geofencing, which other cameras utilize to reduce false informs.</p>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then transmitted over a local location network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
