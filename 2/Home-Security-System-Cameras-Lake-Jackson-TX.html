<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated appearances and face recognition software. The latter enables you to see specifically when a specific person gets to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has actually expanded its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensors known as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to release a wise smoke detector and siren later on this year, which makes this an even better proposal.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
