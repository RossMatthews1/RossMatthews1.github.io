As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
