<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
