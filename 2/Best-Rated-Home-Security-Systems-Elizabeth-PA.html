<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident.
