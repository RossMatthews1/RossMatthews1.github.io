<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings.

The control panel communicates with the other parts of the system, consisting of the cameras, doors and window sensors, and motion sensing units, to detect an intruder or something that is wrong. Then, the monitoring company right away sets to action, connecting with you and alerting the authorities.</p>
