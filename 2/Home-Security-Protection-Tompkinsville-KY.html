<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
