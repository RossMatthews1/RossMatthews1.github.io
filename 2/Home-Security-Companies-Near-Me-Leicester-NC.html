<p>We needed guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to protect the line camping tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to begin the heating unit at 5am. The first guard got here early so he might take a look at the entire area and speak with me about my issues. He was professional, extremely encouraging and polite.
