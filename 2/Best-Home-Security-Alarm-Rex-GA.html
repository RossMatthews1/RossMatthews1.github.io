<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
