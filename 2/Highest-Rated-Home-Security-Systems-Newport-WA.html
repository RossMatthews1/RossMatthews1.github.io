<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, informs, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
