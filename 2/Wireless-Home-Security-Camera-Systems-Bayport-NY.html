<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend just how much is enough.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
