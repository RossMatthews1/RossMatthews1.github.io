Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
