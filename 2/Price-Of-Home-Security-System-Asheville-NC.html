When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
