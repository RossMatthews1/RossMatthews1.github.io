<h3>Best Security System Home Greenbrae CA 94904</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the maker's stats given that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest offender for short battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capacity is a bit restricted to suggest as a top pick.</p>
