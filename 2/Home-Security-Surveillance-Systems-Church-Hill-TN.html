As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
