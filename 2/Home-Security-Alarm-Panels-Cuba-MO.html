<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, catering to sophisticated smart home enthusiasts or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, including smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is costly, additional sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you do not commit to a three-year contract.</p>
