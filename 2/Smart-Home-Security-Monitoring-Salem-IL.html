Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
