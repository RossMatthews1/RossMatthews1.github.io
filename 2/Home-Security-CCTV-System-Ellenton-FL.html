<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the obligation of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to save and for how long you prepare to keep documented video. The video footage is going to consume up storage area quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution.
