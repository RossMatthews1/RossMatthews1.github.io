Windows smash, pet dogs growl, cats scream, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
<p>This absolutely depends on your house. If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll need more sensing units and equipment than someone who lives in a studio apartment.
