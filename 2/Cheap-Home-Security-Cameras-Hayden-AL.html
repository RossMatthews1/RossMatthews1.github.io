<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to strive to make a camera with the most difficult setup understood to male. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you enter the WiFi details of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to send the WiFi information. (You need to play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pet dogs growl, cats scream, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
<p>This absolutely depends on your house. If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll need more sensing units and equipment than someone who lives in a studio apartment.
