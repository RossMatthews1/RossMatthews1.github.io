<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
