Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and use up a lot of recording storage space. A lot, in fact, that they require about four times the hard disk drive space of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage.
