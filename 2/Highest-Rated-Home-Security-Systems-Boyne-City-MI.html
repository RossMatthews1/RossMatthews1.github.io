<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
