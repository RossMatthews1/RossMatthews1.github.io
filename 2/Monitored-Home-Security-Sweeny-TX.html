<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it detected any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would alert users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be an ideal storm of scenarios for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as conclusive, our company believe this problem is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>

Smart Home features include HD video monitoring through wireless security cameras, energy use monitoring with wise thermostats, and other house control including automated locks as well as garage door manages - which can all be controlled with apps.</p>
<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense prevention designed to avoid both individual and home crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will lower crime and boost arrest, without displacing crime to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
