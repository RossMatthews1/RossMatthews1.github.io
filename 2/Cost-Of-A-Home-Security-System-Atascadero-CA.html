How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>

Still, if innovation has actually made us vulnerable, then it can also make us secure. Tech companies have actually been pressing hard to innovate in the linked home CCTV camera space.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
