<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were typically missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.
