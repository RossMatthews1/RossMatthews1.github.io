Those are various solutions with various requirements and objectives.</p>

The Nest Webcam IQ uses face-recognition innovation, for example. It instantly focuses on individuals who go into the field of vision, and sends informs when a face is recognized (it also tells you when an unrecognized face is spotted). This innovation helps eliminate needless alerts.</p>
