<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats given that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant perpetrator for short battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capacity is a bit minimal to recommend as a top choice.</p>
<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a must for usage when you're far from home, however you shouldn't need to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it simple to arm and deactivate the system.
