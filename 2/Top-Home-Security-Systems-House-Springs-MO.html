Wireless security systems are more nimble and integratable, but low signal strength and poor connectivity are still common complaints.

<p>Our burglar alarms might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an offense. As soon as a zone has actually been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
