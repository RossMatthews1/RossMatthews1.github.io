The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
