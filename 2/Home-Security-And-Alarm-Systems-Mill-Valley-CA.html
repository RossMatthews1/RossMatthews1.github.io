<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's toilet.

Most of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and notifies, sensors, gain access to control, and so on. My mind conceived a technique of not just supplying the client with the patient-monitoring system however incorporating it into their antiquated nurse call station system.</p>
<p>Unmonitored systems won't supply the exact same level of protection for your home, either. Even if your system links to your smart device, there are times when you might not be in a position to do anything about an alarm going off, like when you're on an aircraft, in an essential meeting, or in a location without phone reception.
