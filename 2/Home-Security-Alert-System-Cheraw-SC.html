In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security guard. Several cities likewise require a permit to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are designed to restrict the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Numerous towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
