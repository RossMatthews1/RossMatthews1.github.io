<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see exactly when a specific person gets to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.

<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
