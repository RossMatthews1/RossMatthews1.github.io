<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
