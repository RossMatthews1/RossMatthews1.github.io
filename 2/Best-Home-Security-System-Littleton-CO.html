<p>As you simply learned, there are two broad classifications of security cameras. What you usually discover at shops are consumer-grade cameras, which typically come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and sell for less than a thousand dollars (United States $) for the set.

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to sophisticated wise home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, consisting of smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.

<p>Because the glass housing doesn't obstruct, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they make up for it in capabilities. As well as being great for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for low-light and infrared since the glass housing doesn't hinder the lens. With some, it's tough to inform at a glance where they've been aimed, so they can provide a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their real field of view. Setting up a video surveillance system with a few of these is a fantastic alternative for a variety of different setups.</p>
<p>Flood lights are frequently used in conjunction with motion detectors. When sensors spot movement, the lights brighten the surrounding location, which will enable you to see who is on your property and will possibly scare off trespassers.
