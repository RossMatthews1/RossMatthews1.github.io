<h3>Monitored Security Systems Powell OH 43065</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats because this originates from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be helpful for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof since it doesn't have wires that can be cut. Unfortunately I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Kid was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is really great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
