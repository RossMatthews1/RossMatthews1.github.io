All major alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, utilize proximity sensors in the doors and windows as the very first line of defense against prospective robbers, and alarm systems transfer details to a main monitoring station that can dispatch law enforcement quickly and successfully.</p>

IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
