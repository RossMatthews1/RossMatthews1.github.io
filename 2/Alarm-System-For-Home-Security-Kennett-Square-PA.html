All major alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, utilize proximity sensors in the doors and windows as the very first line of defense against prospective robbers, and alarm systems transfer details to a main monitoring station that can dispatch law enforcement quickly and successfully.</p>

Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network.

There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR.
