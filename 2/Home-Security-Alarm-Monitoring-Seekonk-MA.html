<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our testing. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers complimentary perks like person detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 each month.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked just about 50 percent of the time and the camera regularly disconnected from the network multiple times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine). The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, in addition to when we made changes in the settings.</p>
