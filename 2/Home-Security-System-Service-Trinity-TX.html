<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
