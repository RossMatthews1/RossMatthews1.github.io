Normally, you would be notified of a change like this by mail or telephone, not by an unannounced go to by a representative from another company.</p>

An alarm gotten in this manner can not be canceled. A couple of years back, there were only a handful of security companies in the video game. Now, there are dozens. Homeowners selecting a system should look for a reputable, credible company. Many of the very best security companies have actually been in the home security business for decades, long before the idea of self-monitored systems even existed. Trusted companies tend to have much better equipment and client service also.</p>
