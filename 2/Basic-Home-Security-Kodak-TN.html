<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. If you wish to keep an eye on what's taking place in your house when you're not there, but you do not want to buy a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera deserves an appearance.

If you're on a budget plan, you can just about get by with the live motion notifies and livestreaming (no subscription required). The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of technology. For beginners, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey).
