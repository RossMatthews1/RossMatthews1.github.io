<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Should be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
