<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is minimized a remote server run by the manufacturer, instead of at your house) is the standard nowadays, but some cameras save recordings in your area on a microSD card or a linked hard disk. Onboard storage is nice, but it will not be of much assistance if somebody steals the camera. Hackers can get control of wireless camera systems.
