<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering a number of decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and view it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never ever matches the maker's statistics because this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for brief battery life without a doubt.

<p>We enjoy the benefit and versatility of wireless home security cameras. Among our favorites, the Arlo Pro 3, is 100% wire-free.

<p>How long does it generally take to turn to your alarm monitoring service? I utilize VOIP today. May move to cellular eventually in the future however sticking with dial-up in the meantime. Of course, you may wish to think of buying a security camera or more to accompany your system, but going with the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 total) is a little more costly than Frontpoint's the majority of basic package for $320 (or $255 with the 20% advertising deal), which doesn't consist of a camera.</p>
