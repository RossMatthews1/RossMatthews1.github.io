Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that.

<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their portability, impermanence and expandability. Tenants, unlike property owners, generally prevent making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and setting up long-term electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other elements can easily be established at different properties later, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new components too. Wireless security strategies likewise permit remote control of the system and general home automation.
