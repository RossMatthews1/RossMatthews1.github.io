<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
