Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place frequently enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
