In the London subway battles in 2005, terrorists carried bombs onto buses and trains, detonating them throughout heavy traffic. After the terrible attacks, police examined CCTV camera video and saw the terrorists getting in the train station, bring knapsacks loaded with dynamites. The terrorists were taped on several CCTV cameras, however regrettably they were neither discovered nor obstructed before they were able to perform the attacks.</p>

Both are equally susceptible to incorrect alarms, so it depends on your personal preference. Quickly pair with Ring Video Doorbells and Ring Security Cams, Alexa-enabled gadgets and third-party alarm accessories for one complete system.</p>
