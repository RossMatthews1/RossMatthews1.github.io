<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
