<p>All About Security offers professional, reliable alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the greater Indianapolis location. Like any intrusive innovation, the benefits of deploying public camera must be balanced versus the expenses and risks. This technology (a) has the potential change the core experience of going out in public in America because of its chilling impact on people, (b) brings very genuine threats of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not substantially protect us against terrorism.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensors, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
