<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
