One of the things to keep in mind with this choice is the distance from the camera to the wifi connection. Long variety placement might need additional equipment such as wireless radio. This option requires either a recorder or an SD card to save video. Variety is generally around 300 feet barring the lack of physical obstructions like trees and poles.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies whenever you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
