<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal performance.

When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
