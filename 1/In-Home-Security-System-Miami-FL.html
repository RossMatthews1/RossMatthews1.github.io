<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never ever matches the maker's stats since this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for short battery life by far.

<p>This clever smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget.
