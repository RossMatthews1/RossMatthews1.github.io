<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
