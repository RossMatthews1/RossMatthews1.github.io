<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, fraud, and vandalism. Suggestion: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately turn off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can immediately make the wise lights turn on to frighten possible burglars.</p>
