American District Telegraph, the oldest home security provider in the United States, continues to advance a good item. Still the likeliest home security sign you'll see walking down the street, ADT stays at the top of the field by offering a broad variety of services that the majority of its rivals can not match, owing its recognized name and big amount of capital.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
