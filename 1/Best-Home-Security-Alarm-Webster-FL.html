The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 complimentary false alarms per calendar year, because they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
