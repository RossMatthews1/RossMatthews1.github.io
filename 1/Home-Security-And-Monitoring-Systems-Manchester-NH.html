<p>Power-over-Ethernet changes apply only to NVR systems, however they eliminated other parts that would be needed for a DVR system, like additional power sources and the BNC cable televisions used to connect cameras to the DVR. Instead, when you link a PoE switch to your network, you've got a source of power and a means of transferring data to your NVR all in one package.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
