For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment by doing this to make clients stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies suggests numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for consumers. How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
