The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was defective, therefore we might review this evaluation. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud.
