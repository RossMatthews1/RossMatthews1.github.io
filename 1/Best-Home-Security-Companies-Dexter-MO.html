<p>Sensors enable cameras to begin and stop taping based on time or motion detection. The one time where lag does become a little bit of an issue is between recording and detecting movement. Because the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to actually switch on when it identifies motion. If a wicked lawbreaker was quickly enough, they could surpass the camera before it had time to record them. Cell phone can likewise now be used to from another location set and unset alarms by means of apps.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.
