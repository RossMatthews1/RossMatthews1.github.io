Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to save and the length of time you plan to keep taped video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage area rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video that you still need.</p>
