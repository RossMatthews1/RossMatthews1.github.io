<p>For the majority of commercial CCTV systems, structured cabling run throughout the walls, linking your security cameras to the server or NVR, will be an important element. While increasingly more wireless security cameras are becoming popular, specifically for home use, wired security cameras still rule supreme for more irreversible and demanding security usage. Some individuals would rather pay an alarm company the monthly monitoring rate instead of buying a self-monitored security system.

<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
