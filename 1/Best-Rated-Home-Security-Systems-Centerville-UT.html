<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
