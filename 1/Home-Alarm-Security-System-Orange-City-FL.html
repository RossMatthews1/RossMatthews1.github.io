The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
