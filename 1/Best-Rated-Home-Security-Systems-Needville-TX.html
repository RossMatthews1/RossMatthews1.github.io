<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>

The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things plainly.</p>
