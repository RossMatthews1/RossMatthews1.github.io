You may even offer instructions on how to enter into your structure.

<p>In 2015, EFF learned that more than a hundred ALPR cameras were exposed online, typically with absolutely open Web pages available by anyone with a web browser. In some cases, anybody might open an internet browser window and view a camera's live video stream and witness the plate records in real time. We were able to track the cameras to their sources in 5 various instances. Comparable ALPR vulnerabilities were discovered in Boston by DigBoston and the Boston Institute for Nonprofit Journalism.</p>
<p>After ordering, setting up, and using these systems for eight months, we discovered 4 standout companies.
