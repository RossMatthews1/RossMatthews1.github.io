The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night.
