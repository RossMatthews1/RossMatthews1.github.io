<p>There are 2 main types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web protocol (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras.

Here's a take a look at the distinctions in between the 2 types of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more stable than they used to be. However, they are still subject to disturbance and they are still susceptible to being hacked even if the signal is encrypted.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on created to resolve the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
