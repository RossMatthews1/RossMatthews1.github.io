The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
