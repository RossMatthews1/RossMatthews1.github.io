<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings.
