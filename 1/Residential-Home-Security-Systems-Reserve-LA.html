<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
