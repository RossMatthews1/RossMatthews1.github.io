<p>Many wireless home security systems are can be set up by the homeowner and have a simple setup process.

That said, we actually liked Brinks' straightforward package options. You'll have 3 choices to pick from, which vary from basic intrusion protection to full-on intrusion protection + home automation + video surveillance. We really delighted in using Brinks' video functions, and we like how their top-tier bundle includes an HD video doorbell for good step.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in customer reviews, and it delivers a crisp image up to 32 feet. And despite the fact that the app and software are easy to work with, it's a little bit of a letdown that you can't incorporate this camera with any wise home centers or devices. A lot of clever cameras can be set to do things like this, however few make things as easy as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives easier and Hive's environment lives up to that. It's all the function with no frustration.</p>
