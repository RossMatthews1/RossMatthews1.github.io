In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
