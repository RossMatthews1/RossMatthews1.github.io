<p>Twenty-five years ago, basic and business communications were mainly simultaneous. To accomplish practically anything, somebody live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, specifically when dealing with national and worldwide business. The same applies for security and video surveillance. Generally, CCTV is most reliable as an active system, with a security personnel monitoring the corridors and another person, someplace, enjoying video surveillance screens for support. Everything is synchronized and everything occurs in real time.</p>
<p>The majority of contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to reap a few of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs convert the analog video footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capability, makes it much easier to search archived video, and also enables users to stream video over a network for remote watching from several locations. Typically, the simple presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated intruders. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or harmed by the more determined robbers. If intruders can not see any security cameras, they might also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
