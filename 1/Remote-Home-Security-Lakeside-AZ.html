<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
