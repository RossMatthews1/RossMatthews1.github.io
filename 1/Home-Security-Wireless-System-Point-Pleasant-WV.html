<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
