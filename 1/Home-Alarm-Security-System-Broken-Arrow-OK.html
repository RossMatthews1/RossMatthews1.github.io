Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
