Outdoor cameras should be weather condition resistant and in many cases, completely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance ranking are the most resilient. Because their style allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives.

(You need to play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, dogs wail, cats scream, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>
