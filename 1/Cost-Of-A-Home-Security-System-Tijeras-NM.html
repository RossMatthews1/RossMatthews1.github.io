Now, most security systems involve a great number of elements, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensing units, a keypad, and crucial fobs, to name a few components. But I also value minimalist systems that parts that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation readily available to you.
