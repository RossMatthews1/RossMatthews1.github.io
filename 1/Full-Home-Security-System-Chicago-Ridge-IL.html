<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning a number of decades.

The innovation gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems readily available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>As more and more authorities departments charge the client for cops response, is monitoring truly desired?

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
