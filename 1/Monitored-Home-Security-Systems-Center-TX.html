<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras decrease crime. HD CCTV systems are compatible with conventional analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable (take a look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that suggests you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. You can update your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax facilities if you buy HD-CCTV security system. That's simply $0.63 a day (or about $19 a month) for the House Iota All-in-One security camera, an extra contact sensing unit, and a remote essential fob.

However that does not mean you can't utilize analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to leverage your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>
