The Wyze Camera can likewise capture video to the cloud, however the free account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That suggests the camera will wait 5 minutes before it has the ability to tape again, which indicates you might be missing out on a lot. Wyze's just recently released Total Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly starts another, with no gaps in between.
