<p>After ordering, setting up, and utilizing these systems for eight months, we found four standout companies. Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all provide an exceptional consumer experience and user-friendly, innovative security tech. We 'd be comfy outfitting our own homes with any of them-- although each excels in a specific area.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
