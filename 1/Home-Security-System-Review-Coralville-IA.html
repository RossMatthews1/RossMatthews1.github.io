<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly innovative, so we're actually advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year contract, but considering that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a big dedication.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
