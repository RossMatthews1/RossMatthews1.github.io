Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, consisting of smart things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. However the Secure is expensive, extra sensing units are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you do not dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>
