<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and once again in customer reviews, and it delivers a crisp image up to 32 feet.

A great deal of clever cameras can be configured to do things like this, but couple of make things as basic as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that.

Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
