<p>To determine reaction times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units.

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security guard. A number of cities also need an authorization to even own and operate a home security system.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
