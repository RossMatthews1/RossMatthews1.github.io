Tenants, unlike property owners, usually avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can quickly be established at various homes later on, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also allow remote control of the system and general home automation.
