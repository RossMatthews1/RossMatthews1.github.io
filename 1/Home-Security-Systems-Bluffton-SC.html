<p>Honeywell's Do It Yourself security system relies on a device called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top. It works as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensing units and 3rd party-devices through Z-Wave and managing them using the app or voice control. Another location where Arlo excels is customer care.

<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most affordable monitoring plan beginning at $10.

However, you will have to spend for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) monthly, and this doesn't come with professional monitoring.

For even more basic smarts, it's terrific, though. If you don't currently have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to require to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are range problems.</p>
