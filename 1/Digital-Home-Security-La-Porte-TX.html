<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and for that reason offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
