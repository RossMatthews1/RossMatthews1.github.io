<p>You can use a wireless connection to operate your SimpliSafe system, however it does not support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, indicating you won't have the ability to connect it directly to other third-party gadgets like clever locks or automate certain actions in the home.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
