We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were often missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home gadgets like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and check that you locked your doors.
