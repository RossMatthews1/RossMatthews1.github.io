However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink doesn't give you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.

The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve detail after the fact, which implies that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and use up a lot of recording storage area.
