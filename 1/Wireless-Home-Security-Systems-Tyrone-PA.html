You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "people might find out to be careful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers.

Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
