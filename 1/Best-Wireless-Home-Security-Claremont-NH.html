<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to aim to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your e-mail address.

<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
