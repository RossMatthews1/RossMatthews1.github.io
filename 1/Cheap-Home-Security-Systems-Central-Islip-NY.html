However, wise alarms do require a hub that enables the different parts to wirelessly link. However for most clever alarms this hub can be placed anywhere in your home.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
