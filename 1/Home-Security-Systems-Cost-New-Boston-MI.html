<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful assaulter, because the disturbance of the network prevents the circulation of information and actually indirectly safeguards data by preventing it from being transferred. The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the destructive enemy to tape-record these codes and utilize numerous breaking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security key captured during the network recovery.</p>

<p>We needed guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to secure the line tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heater at 5am. The very first guard got here early so he could look at the entire location and speak with me about my issues. He was professional, polite and very encouraging. The 2nd guard showed up in the middle of the night and took over. When I got here in the early morning to get the event started, he was also professional, reassuring and courteous. We were extremely pleased with your service and I will advise that we contact your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. When after leaving our residential or commercial property in your hands, I didn't fret.</p>
