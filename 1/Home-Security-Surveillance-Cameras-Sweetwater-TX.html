In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll require to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
