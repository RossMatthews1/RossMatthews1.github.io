But I also appreciate minimalist systems that parts that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation available to you.

Should be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
