<p>Home security systems and modern-day clever home capabilities and compatibilities enable you to take advantage of their sensors and cameras directly from your phone. Try to find a model that provides a high resolution (1080p), a wide angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range approximately 25 feet, and budget friendly cloud storage for tape-recorded video. In some cases it's valuable to be able to see what occurred right before or after a visitor approaches your door.
