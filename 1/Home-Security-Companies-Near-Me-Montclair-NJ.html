<p>GO2 provides full-service Video Surveillance Installation of high definition (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Of course, the obvious drawback to a wired security system is that the initial install can be costly. If the system was not set up during the homebuilding process, setting one up might need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and accessing to difficult spots that are sealed in attics or basements. Wired security systems are also susceptible to power failures. Many will have a backup battery system that turns on in the event of a failure, but long term interruptions will result in the system losing power. When selecting a wired system, it's also essential to consider how long you plan to stay at the very same residence. Because these security systems are incorporated into the home's circuitry, they are not portable and can't move with you.</p>
<p>Door and Window Sensors: In many cases, the only way somebody can get into your home is through a door or window. When you have one of our security alarms in location, if anybody opens a door or window to your home anytime when the system is armed, our main monitoring system will be alerted right away so you can take quick action.

<p>The security systems I've created and implemented are strictly for monitoring activity of a potential target, whether from a terrorist threat or area thieves or vandals. The systems are deployed for the protection of lives and residential or commercial property and not to view people as they jaywalk across the street or run a red light (which both are, by the way, versus the law). Those are various options with various requirements and goals.</p>
<p>Downsides: incredibly sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would trigger the sensors to stop working, and need sterilized perimeter line since bushes and trees or anything that blocks the beam would trigger incorrect alarm or absence of detection. If clever home security is what you seek, we recommend checking out Vivint or ADT before getting on the more affordable, DIY bandwagon. However if your main goal is keeping criminals out of your house and protecting your residential or commercial property, you don't need to spend a bundle.</p>
