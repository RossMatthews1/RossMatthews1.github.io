When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, again based on whether or not the design is generally open or usually closed. This action coupled with an electrical present (generally at 12V DC) enables an alarm control board to discover a fault on that zone or circuit.

<p>Another crucial topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much suffices. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
